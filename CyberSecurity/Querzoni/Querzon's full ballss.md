# Email Security 1

- Email, a system for exchanging digital messages across the internet, operates on a store-and-forward model using mail transfer agents (MTAs).
- Message user agents (MUAs) compose and access emails, while mail submission agents (MSAs) ensure messages meet format standards before delivery.
- The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) handles email transmission, using message envelopes and the "user@domain" address format.
- Messages follow the Internet Message Format (IMF), including headers (with fields like From, To, Subject, and Date) and a body.
- Message-ID and ENVID uniquely identify messages.
- For accessing mailboxes, users employ protocols like POP and IMAP.
- Alice composes an email and sends it using her Mail User Agent (MUA) and the Submission Protocol.
- The Message Submission Agent (MSA) determines the recipient's mail exchange server using DNS.
- The message is then sent via SMTP to the recipient's mail exchange server, potentially through multiple MTAs.
- Finally, Bob retrieves the message using his MUA and either POP3 or IMAP4.
- RFC 5321 (2008) replaced ESMTPPRFC 821 (1982), introducing ESMTP, an extended SMTP version.
- Software should use ESMTP, but SMTP is supported for backward compatibility.
- EHLO is the ESMTP greeting command.
- MIME, an internet standard, extends email formats to support various character sets, non-text attachments, and multipart bodies.
- It's used in almost all email and described in six RFCs, including RFC 822 and RFC 2045-2049. MIME supports text, images, audio, video, and other data types.
- Key MIME features include character set support, content type labeling, non-text content support, and compound document support.
- Non-ASCII characters are handled using charset parameters in the Content-Type header.
- MIME uses base64 or quoted-printable encoding for non-text content.
- Multipart subtypes include mixed, digest, message, and alternative.
- Modern email clients often use HTML for email bodies, often including a plain text version.
- Local subaddressing uses tags in the email address for mailbox aliases.
- The email, sent from Crisis 2024 to Leonardo Querzoni at querzoni@diag.uniroma1.it, concerns instructions for final paper submission.
- The email's subject is "Instructions for Final Paper Submission - CRiSIS 2024." The sender's address is crisis2024@easychair.org.
- RFC5233 Domain subaddressing allows the use of local names as domain subaddresses, which can be defined freely; for example, mastercourses@querzoni.diag.uniroma1.it is equivalent to querzoni@diag.uniroma1.it.

# Email Security 2

- Email systems face various threats, including spam, phishing, malware distribution, email spoofing, lack of traceability, data leakage, Man-in-the-Middle attacks, Business Email Compromise, and email bombing.
- Examples of email spoofing are provided, showing emails seemingly from "Polizia criminale" and "*SAPIENZAN*," sent to Leonardo Querzoni.
- This email, sent from gaia.fiore@uniroma1.it to leonardo.querzoni@uniroma1.it with the subject "QUESTA AZIONE Ãˆ OBBLIGATORIA," discusses email security challenges.
- These challenges include a lack of sender authentication and end-to-end encryption.
- The email mentions solutions like Sender Policy Framework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC), and Authenticated Receiver Chain (ARC) to address these issues.
- **SPF (Sender Policy Framework)** verifies the sending server's IP address against the domain's SPF record, allowing domain owners to specify authorized mail servers.
  - A successful SPF check confirms the sender's authorization, while failure may lead to rejection or flagging of the email.
  - However, SPF has limitations, including potential failures with email forwarding, shared services, mailing lists, and size restrictions.
  - It doesn't protect email content or fully verify the sender's address in the header.
- **DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)** cryptographically signs email messages, verifying content integrity and domain authentication through DNS-published public keys.
  - The signing process adds a DKIM-Signature header, and verification uses the published public key.
  - DKIM uses selectors to subdivide key namespaces, supporting multiple public keys per signing domain.
  - Selectors might identify office locations, signing dates, or users.
  - This allows for delegating signing capabilities, enabling local message sending for travelers, and supporting "affinity" domains forwarding mail without their own MSA.
  - Recipient mail servers verify DKIM signatures using the specified selector to retrieve the public key from DNS, checking the signature against the message content.
  - A valid signature confirms message integrity and authenticity; an invalid signature indicates alteration or a key mismatch, potentially leading to rejection or quarantine depending on other factors like DMARC policy.
- SPF authenticates the sending server's IP address, while DKIM verifies email content using a public key.
- DKIM doesn't authenticate the visible "From" address and can be broken by email forwarding that alters content.
- **DMARC** is a standard combining SPF and DKIM to protect against spam and spoofing.
  - It allows organizations to publish email authentication practices and specify actions for failed authentication checks, using policies like "none," "quarantine," or "reject."
  - DMARC checks DKIM signature validation, SPF record compliance, and domain alignment.
  - Receiving servers report outcomes to the sending domain, providing aggregate and forensic reports.
  - Strict DMARC policies can block legitimate messages due to indirect mailflows altering messages or IP addresses.
- **Authenticated Received Chain (ARC)** maintains the authenticated status of emails traversing multiple servers.
  - It ensures that successful SPF, DKIM, and DMARC checks at the origin are preserved.
  - Each intermediary adds its authentication results, creating a traceable chain of custody.
  - This improves email deliverability, especially for emails processed by mailing lists or forwarding services, by aiding in passing DMARC checks.
  - ARC complements, not replaces, DMARC.
  - Authenticated Received Chain (ARC) adds three header fields:
    - ARC-Authentication-Results.
    - ARC-Seal.
    - ARC-Message-Signature.
  - These verify email authenticity and integrity through intermediaries.
  - ARC doesn't address sender trustworthiness or message content; intermediaries might still alter content or headers.
  - ARC-Seal cryptographically signs ARC headers, while ARC-Message-Signature signs the entire message (excluding ARC-Seal).
  - Intermediaries add ARC headers only when changes might affect DMARC checks.
  - Verification involves checking the ARC-Seal and ARC-Message-Signature signatures, Authentication Results, and the entire ARC chain.
- **PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)** uses strong cryptography to provide confidentiality, authentication, and integrity for emails, employing public and private keys and a "web of trust" for key management.
  - Individuals gather and share digital signatures, expecting recipients to trust some signers.
  - This creates a decentralized, resilient network of trust for public keys.
- **S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)** offers similar assurances to PGP but employs a centralized PKI for key management and X.509 certificates instead of simple key pairs.
  - This approach offers less user control but improved interoperability.
